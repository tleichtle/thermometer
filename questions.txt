* Push or poll? I.e. should the sensor push data to a server or should clients poll the sensor?
    -> Poll. Sensor offers API.
    -> ? Recheck for "very low energy usage" (e.g. sensor battery version)

* What format should the data be offered?
    -> JSON.
    -> E.g. see https://techtutorialsx.com/2017/04/27/esp32-creating-json-message/

* Should the sensor buffer values?
    -> No. Readings are done when clients request it.

* What about the time?
    -> Clients can map their requests to the time.
    -> Could be added to json, but why?

* Should temperature be offered in degree and fahrenheit?
    -> No, degrees only. Clients can do the math if needed.
